                <h2>The Equality Act 2010</h2>

                <p>
                    Equal rights to accessing online content for disabled users is covered by the
                    Equality Act 2010.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        Under the Act duty holders must make “reasonable adjustments” to prevent
                    “substantial disadvantage” by ensuring “information is provided in an
                    accessible format”. Organisations providing a service to the public “must not
                    discriminate against a person requiring the service”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Act also places requirements on public authorities to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>eliminate discrimination</li>
                    <li>advance equality of opportunity; and</li>
                    <li>foster good relations between those who are protected, such as disabled</li>
                    <li>or older users and those who are not. </li>
                </ul>
